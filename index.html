<!-- *** Program Objectives *** -->
    <section class="grid-container" id="objectives">
      <div class="grid-row grid-gap">
        <div class="grid-col-fill">
          <h2 class="text-primary-dark">Program Objectives</h2>
          <h4 class="text-primary margin-top-5">What you’ll learn:</h4>
          <p>Throughout this program, you’ll be taught how to translate critical concepts and best practices in the field of technical hiring, into effective, real-world practice. Attracting the best and most qualified technical talent to an organization is not solely a challenge faced by the government. Industry also shares these challenges, as we all recognize the exponential value that superior technical talent can bring to an organization. In order to help overcome these growing needs and inherent challenges, it’s crucial to educate and train hiring stakeholders. It’s also equally important to discuss and educate on commercial trends and technology like AI that are designed to help with speeding up the time to hire, streamlining processes, budget savings, and providing data analysis.</p>
          <h5 class="text-primary margin-top-5">Digital hiring in the 21st century government</h5>
          <p>Modern recruitment methodologies must include innovative strategies that agencies can use to identify top talent for their openings. Hiring the right candidate for a role has never been more important as Millennials and Generation Z rapidly become the cornerstone of the workforce. With the continual and rapid evolution of technology and work ethics, recruiters now have a wide range of techniques and tools at their disposal to source, recruit, engage, and enhance the candidate search processes. You will learn how to use these tools and best practices to work for you.</p>
          <h5 class="text-primary margin-top-5">Recruiting using modern methods</h5>
          <p>Developing an organizational talent strategy within the fast paced technology sector can be an extremely challenging task for any organization, but especially so for the federal government that oftentimes faces constraints with factors such as technology, budget, and lack of flexibility allotted with policy, process, procedure, and even sheer size, which can impact time to hire, as well as quality of candidates.</p>
          <h5 class="text-primary margin-top-5">How to hire</h5>
          <p>Understanding how modern technology roles align with occupational series, General Schedule levels, and pay scales (if not on the General Schedule). Oftentimes Hiring managers don’t know what mechanisms and authorities are at their disposal. Their concerns revolve around budget, time, and identifying the best possible candidate to fit their needs while adhering to their agency's policy and regulations. With well over 100 different hiring authorities, the federal recruitment and hiring process can be both intimidating and a challenge to navigate for many that are involved in the hiring process. You’ll learn how to determine which hiring authorities align to your needs.</p>
          <h5 class="text-primary margin-top-5">Leading change as a hiring professional</h5>
          <p>You will learn how to craft an effective hiring strategy that your agency can successfully leverage for a wide range of tech skills. You will also meet and network with other agency partners to learn how they have been able to successfully attract, hire, and retain highly sought after tech talent. This will include strategies like candidate pooling and skills based hiring, shared hiring, capturing data and metrics, evaluating success, and building knowledge share/support mechanisms to help you succeed after you’re back within your agency. The goal is to be equipped with essential tools, support, and be able to collaborate with new connections in order to successfully make a meaningful impact to mission critical hiring objectives.</p>
